There are two ways to run the program, you can either manually compile and run or you could run the script that I've attached (named run.sh)

Option 1:
	- For ease of use, I've created a simple script to compile and run my program
	- Open a command like prompt
	- Navigate your way to the project folder where bin/ and src/ can be found
	- Simple type and run: ./run.sh
	- Watch it compile, run and output the code according to the homework prompt
Option 2:
	- Just in case Option 1 didn't work for some reason...
	- Open a command line prompt
	- Navigate your way to the project folder where bin/ and src/ can be found
	- To compile, type and run: javac -d bin/ -cp src src/slcsp/slcsp.java
		- This will compile the code and place the class file into the bin/ folder
	- To run the code, type and run: java -cp bin slcsp.slcsp
	- Watch it run and output the code according to the homework prompt

I hope that you enjoy looking through my code!
